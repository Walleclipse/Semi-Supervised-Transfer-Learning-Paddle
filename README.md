This repository is for Adaptive Knowledge Consistency and Adaptive Representation Consistency introduced in the following paper:
 
Abulikemu Abuduweili, Xingjian Li, Humphrey Shi, Cheng-Zhong Xu, and Dejing Dou, [Adaptive Consistency Regularization for Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02193), CVPR 2021,  

The code is implemented by [PaddlePaddle]( http://paddlepaddle.org).   
Pytorch implementation is in [here](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Semi-Supervised-Transfer-Learning).
